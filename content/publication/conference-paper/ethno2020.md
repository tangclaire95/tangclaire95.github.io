abstract: Students in Hong Kong experience three language dispositioning changes during their study. They learn Mandarin for their subject of “Chinese”; the instruction language of other subjects is Cantonese; English is required in universities. Although college students and the teacher are Hong Kong locals who share the same linguistic background and are able to speak Cantonese, they are not allowed to use languages other than English in class. This study would examine that to what extent local university students in Hong Kong sharing the same linguistic repertoire actually use translanguaging in their interactions; second, how translanguaging approach enables Hong Kong English learners to scaffold each other and facilitate language learning to co-construct meanings; third, whether the translanguaging approach has implications for educational settings.
