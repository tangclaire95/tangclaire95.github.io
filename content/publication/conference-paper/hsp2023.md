#abstract: This study investigated the processing differences between subject relative clauses (SRCs) and object relative clauses (ORCs) in Mandarin Chinese. The presence of temporary parsing ambiguities in both types of clauses makes it challenging to isolate the effects of dependency resolution. To address this, a self-paced reading study was conducted, manipulating RC type (SRC vs. ORC) and the presence of a classifier that either mismatched or matched with the adjacent noun. The results showed that when the classifier mismatched, ORCs were processed faster than SRCs, indicating an object advantage. These findings highlight the role of linear distance in syntactic processing and offer insights into the Mandarin SRC/ORC asymmetry.
