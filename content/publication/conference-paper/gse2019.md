abstract: This study, which was conducted within the restaurant- “&pizza”, focuses on the speech event- ordering pizza and the contextualization cues used by the server and new customers to develop comembership and repair crosstalk. The research questions are- how do new customers socialize themselves into the community? Do customers from various cultural backgrounds react to the same contextualization cues differently? If so, how? And how do they develop comembership and repair crosstalk? Based on my research, I find that the customers from various cultural backgrounds do react to the same contextualization cue differently. And they socialize themselves into the new community by employing different strategies.
