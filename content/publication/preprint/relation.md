abstract: Visual perception extends beyond perceiving objects in isolation; it involves representing them within relational contexts. This perception of objects also differs linguistically, where categorization and visual perception differ. When considering a cat in a box, where understanding extends beyond individual entities to spatial relations (“a cat in a box”). Studies propose that an object's shape minimally influences its representation when in relation to other objects (Landau & Jackendoff, 1993). In our experiment, we aimed to investigate how Mandarin speakers’ perception for the novel shape might be influenced by the presence of spatial relationships. Participants were shown some novel shapes called “dax”—possessing shape features associated with a specific shape-based classifier—in two scene types- either presented alone (i.e., in isolation) or situated in spatial relation to a familiar object (i.e., in relation), and asked to type a classifier to complete a sentence “This is one __ dax and a bowl.” Our findings revealed a significant impact of scene type, demonstrating an “isolation advantage”- fewer shape-based classifiers were used when “dax” was in a spatial relation, while abstract classifiers remained consistent. This suggests reduced sensitivity to specific shape properties in relational contexts, altering geometric perception based on object categorization versus relational contexts.
